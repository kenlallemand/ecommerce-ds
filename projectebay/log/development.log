DEPRECATION WARNING: Passing a class to the `class_name` is deprecated and will raise an ArgumentError in Rails 5.2. It eagerloads more classes than necessary and potentially creates circular dependencies. Please pass the class name as a string: `belongs_to :cover, class_name: 'Picture'` (called from <class:Product> at /home/RubyProjects/projectebay/app/models/product.rb:7)

It eagerloads more classes than necessary and potentially creates circular dependencies.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Passing a class to the `class_name` is deprecated and will raise an ArgumentError in Rails 5.2. It eagerloads more classes than necessary and potentially creates circular dependencies. Please pass the class name as a string: `belongs_to :cover, class_name: 'Picture'` (called from <class:Product> at /home/RubyProjects/projectebay/app/models/product.rb:7)
